TODO Hackathon:

1) Implement a timer for the agents inside the Java server

2) ~~Debug the Java server~~ (OK for now)

3) ~~Save the output files in the Java server~~

4) ~~Implement a game visualizer~~

5) ~~Implement a GameSimulation object in order to easily run many simulations in parallel~~

6) More game loop steps should be done between the commands asked to the AI. As per now, 4 steps per second create collision glitches.

6) Implement an 'Organizer AI' (@stefano).

7) Create a python script for pool simulation using the openshift cluster.

8) Set NO winner upon equality inside java client.
