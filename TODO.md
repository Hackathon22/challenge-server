TODO Hackathon:

1) Implement a timer for the agents inside the Java server

2) ~~Debug the Java server~~ (OK for now)

3) ~~Save the output files in the Java server~~

4) ~~Implement a game visualizer~~

5) ~~Implement a GameSimulation object in order to easily run many simulations in parallel~~

6) ~~More game loop steps should be done between the commands asked to the AI. As per now, 4 steps per second create collision glitches.~~

6) Implement an 'Organizer AI' (@stefano).

7) Create a python script for pool simulation using the openshift cluster.

8) Set NO winner upon equality inside java client.

9) Reorder the UI indications as from teams (instead of first agent inserted)

10) Finish game gracefully at the end of the commands in replay mode
